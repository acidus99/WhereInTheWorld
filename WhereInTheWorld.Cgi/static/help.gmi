# 🗺 Help - Where In The World?

Where In the World (WITW) is a geography puzzle game.

Every day, a new country or territory is selected. You have 6 guesses to name it. The game resets every day.

## How do I play?

At the top of the screen there is an ASCII art image of the country, as well as a link to a higher resolution image, like this:

Below that is a list of countries or territories to guess. Just click on a link to guess that country. As you guess countries, your guesses will be removed from the list.

When you guess, WITW tells you how close you are. For example, if I guess "Cuba", and I see this:

* Guess 1. Cuba | 7982 km | ➡️ | 60 %

My guess was wrong. The actual country is 7982 kilometers to the west of Cuba. I'm 60% close.
Next I guess "Algeria" and get:

* Guess 2. Algeria | 2164 km | ⬆️ | 89 %

Oh nice! I'm wrong again, but I'm getting close! The actual country is 2164 km north of Algeria. I'm going to try "Belgium"

* Guess 3. Belgium | 494 km | ↘️ | 98 %

Almost there. The actual country is just 494 km south east of Beligum. I guess "Switzerland"

* Guess 4. Switzerland | 0 km | 🎉 | 100 %

Hurray, I win! WITW also generates a spoiler-free game summary, that shows how close you were with each guess. You copy and paste that summary to share you victory on Station!

## Tips

* If you don't know, its helpful to pick a country you do know the location of, even if you know that's not the answer, just to give you a data point about how close you are and what direction you need to go in.
* Look at the borders closely. This can help you determine if its an island, or a coastal country, or another feature.
* The earth is approximately 40,000 km around. Your guess will never be farther away than about 20,000 km. If you see a guess that is like 16,000 km away, think about what countries are on the other side of the world from your guess.

## I hax0r3d your game
The guesses are stored in the URL's query string. You can totally cheat by "undoing" a guess by removing it from your query string. I could prevent this by requiring client-side certificates and tracking state server-side, but that would increase the work you have to do to play the game. And you could still cheat by just looking at a world map. I can't stop you from cheating. Don't be a jerk.
